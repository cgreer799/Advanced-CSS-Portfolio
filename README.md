# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

This is a portfolio template website that I will be adding to with projects I make in my coding bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment is to practice the use of HTML and CSS while laying the groundwork of a usable portfolio website to be used during job searches. I was not provided any starter code, only the following screenshot:
